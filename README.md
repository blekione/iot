## IOT 

IoT project which uses Wio Node controllers as a source of metrics.

This is a side project which aim is to leran new things and consolidate what I learn recently.

The idea is to create modular project based on maven modules. The final result will be a web application to prrersent metrrrics from sensors.

The tehnology stack:
* Java
* Maven as build tool
* Kubernetes and Docker
* Kafka
* Diffusion
* Java Script at front-end

## Modules

sensor-reader  - is a Java wrapper for Wio Node API.
